# Compiler Notes

- Compilers   off-line
- Interpreters	on-line

## 1. Structure of compiler
1. Lexical Analysis 
	- divides program to text into "words" or "tokens"
2. Parsing 
	- create syntax tree 
3. Semantic Analysis 
	- find limited semantic mistakes 
4. Optimization 
	- Run faster 
	- Use less memory 
	- Low  power 
	- Network 
	- Database 
5. Code Generation 
	- translate to another language 

## 2. Economy of programming language 
 
1. Widely used languages are slow to change.
2. Easy to start a new language.
3. Languages adopted to fill a void.

## 3. COOL
Classroom object oriented language = COOL
